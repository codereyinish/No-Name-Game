#No-Name-Game
Welcome to No_NAME_GAME
A  single-player JavaScript game designed entirely with flexbox. I can proudly say, this game is a product of my own original creativity and passion for game design. Every aspect of it has been brainstormed and developed by me, from the concept to the gameplay mechanics. 

Here is how to play this Game:
1. Click the "Start Game" button below to begin.
2. Navigate the grid of squares by clicking on them.
3. Whenever you click on a tile, the number on it reverses.
4. Your goal is to uncover all the remaining tiles in a way such that the reversed number on a flipped tile shouldn't already be present among the unclicked tiles.
6. Complete the game to win.
7. Click "Play Again" to restart the game.
Enjoy playing [Game Name]! Have fun and aim for the highest score!

While I continue to work on enhancing the game with new levels and features, I invite you to enjoy the current version and share your feedback. Your suggestions are highly valued and will contribute to making this game even better
